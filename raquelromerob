I´m Teacher in a School.
I´m student DLP - Introduction to Computer Science.
I´m currently learning Projekt Manager und Scrum Master.
I live in Munich.
I am very motivated to do this course, because I find this topic super interesting. 
I also want to direct my professional career in this sector.
and I see that this training can be a great opportunity for my professional future.
I´m not experience with It Computer, because I worked as a teacher in a school 
and it had nothing to do with this field.
